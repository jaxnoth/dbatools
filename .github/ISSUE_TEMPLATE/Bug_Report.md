### Report

<!--
Things to consider:
- Errors received are not related to permissions?
- Have you tried the same command using powershell.exe instead of a hosted powershell instance like ISE or VS Code?
- If this refers to Copy-DbaDatabase can you replace the problem with Backup-DbaDatabase and Restore-DbaDatabase?
- Copy-DbaDatabase will not work in every environment and every situation. Instead, we try to ensure Backup & Restore work in your environment.
